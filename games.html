                <p>
                    The first ever Five Night's At Freddy's game that has been released on August 8th.
                    <br>
                    You'll be playing as a security night guard in a family restaurant where you'll constantly
                    <br>
                    have to check the security cameras and close the doors next to you for if you see or hear anything
                    odd.
                    <br>
                    But beware, the amount of electricty you're using has a limit! Once it's down to 0% you're gone!
                    <br>
                    With that said, don't let those animatronics enter your office and you'll be fine! ..Or will you be?

                <h3>FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 2</h3>
                <p>
                    The second game of Five Nights at Freddy's! Once more, you'll be playing as a security guard working
                    at
                    <br>
                    night. Your job is to monitor the cameras alone and make sure that nothing goes wrong. For obvious
                    reasons,
                    <br>
                    back in the first game, the first security guard complained about animatronics trying to get into
                    the office.
                    <br>
                    To prevent that, you've been provided with your very own Freddy Fazbear mask to fool them to leave
                    you alone
                    <br>
                    if you ever find them 'accidentally' entering your office.
                    <br>
                    But beware, there's one that won't be fooled by that stupid mask of yours!
                    <br>
                    Remember, Fazbear Entertainment is NOT resposible for death or dismemberment. :]

                <h3>FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 3</h3>
                <p>
                    30 long years after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza had closed its doors due to gruesome events..
                    <br>
                    is nothing more but a rumor and a childhood memory.
                    <br>
                    However, the owners of 'Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction' were determined enough to
                    <br>
                    revive the 'legend'. You work as a security guard and is in charge for the ventilation system,
                    <br>
                    camera system and audio devices. However as expected, you're not alone, 'luckily' you're stuck
                    <br>
                    with just one animatronic. To prevent him from entering your office, PLAY THE AUDIO.
